## 1.0 Introduction
### What is Kuros WTT?
Kuros WTT is a web testing toolkit that is designed to make web testing easier. 
It is a collection of tools that can be used to test web applications.
Its meant to be treated as a web scanner that provides in-depth info about the target. 
Using diffrent levels of scanning, you can get more info about the 
target. It should alert to possible vulnerabilities and provide info about the target. 
It will not exploit the vulnerabilities, but it will alert you to them. 

(this script is the automation of many other tools)
